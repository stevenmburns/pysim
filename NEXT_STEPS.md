# Next steps — pysim

Living roadmap of what's done and what's left. Updated as work lands.

## Where we are

The codebase has one active solver, two optional comparators (a NEC-faithful and a higher-order-basis arbiter), and one legacy comparator:

- **`pysim.triangular.TriangularPySim`** (in `src/pysim/triangular.py`) — piecewise-linear (tent) basis with Galerkin testing and analytic singularity extraction. Accepts arbitrary 3D polylines, multiple wires, an optional PEC-image ground plane, and (PR #36) wire-endpoint junctions where K wires meet — KCL is enforced via a Lagrange-multiplier row per junction. Converges fast (~80 segments to NEC accuracy) AND to a finite reactance limit. C++ accelerator (`_accelerators.cpp`) handles the bottleneck quadrature and Z assembly on non-junction geometries; junction geometries take a generalised Python assembly path. Drives every interactive web-UI antenna: inverted V, Yagi (with N directors), moxon, hexbeam, and fan dipole.
- **`pysim.sinusoidal.SinusoidalPySim`** (in `src/pysim/sinusoidal.py`, PR #44) — NEC2's three-term (const + sin + cos per segment) basis with closed-form Wu-King coefficients (Eqs 43-64 of the LLNL theory manual). Thin-wire kernel, delta-gap applied-E source, uniform wire radius, free space only. Same constructor surface as `TriangularPySim` (wires / `n_per_edge_per_wire` / junctions / `feed_wire_index` / `feed_arclength`). Used as the in-codebase NEC-faithful comparator — reproduces PyNEC R+jX to ~0.05 Ω on the hentenna across n=15..281 (see item 14).
- **`pysim.bspline.BSplinePySim`** (in `src/pysim/bspline.py`, PR #45) — degree-d B-spline Galerkin MoM (currently d ∈ {1, 2}). Polynomial-per-segment basis with the same multi-wire / polyline / junction / KCL machinery as `TriangularPySim`. Closed-form same-edge static-kernel moment integrals J_pq for p, q ∈ {0..2} sympy-derived once and dumped to `_bspline_static_moments.py` — no runtime sympy dependency. Used as the in-codebase higher-order-basis arbiter: a polynomial basis family completely independent from `TriangularPySim`'s tent basis. d=2 on the hentenna lands at the same 43.05 + j38.84 as `TriangularPySim` (see item 9/13/14 — this settles the arbitration). Pure-numpy (no C++ accelerator yet); free space only.
- **`pysim.PySim`** (in `src/pysim/__init__.py`) — legacy pulse-basis MoM, kept only as a convergence comparator. Single straight wire, both `engine="python"` and `engine="accelerated"`. Converges slowly (the real part by ~N=1000–5000 segments, the imag part logarithmically *diverges* with N — see [docs/convergence_analysis.md](docs/convergence_analysis.md)).

The legacy `_legacy.py`, the spline experiments (`spline.py`, `bspline.py`, `augmented_spline.py`), the `icecream` dependency, the separate `pysim.yagi.YagiPySim` class, and the separate `BentTriangularPySim` in `triangular_bent.py` are all gone — the latter two were consolidated into `TriangularPySim`. `docs/convergence_analysis.md` documents the NEC validation campaign that motivated the triangular work.

## Done in recent PRs (don't redo)

- **PR #1** — branch infrastructure cleanup
- **PR #2** — `slow`/`plot` pytest markers, CI filter, NEC comparison scripts, [convergence analysis writeup](docs/convergence_analysis.md), port `YagiPySim` to the `(l_endpoints, r_endpoints)` interface
- **PR #3** — `TriangularPySim` v1 with full analytic static-kernel extraction; `scripts/bspline_probe.py`; smoke test asserting it matches NEC to a few Ω
- **PR #4** — Delete spline modules + drop `icecream` dep; wire `engine="accelerated"` into the new `PySim`; delete `_legacy.py`; silence headless-test `FigureCanvasAgg` warnings
- **PR #5** — `TriangularYagiPySim`: multi-wire triangular Galerkin solver (driver + reflector). Same-wire blocks reuse the analytic static-kernel extraction; cross-wire blocks use direct Gauss-Legendre quadrature on the full kernel. `scripts/compare_yagi_nec.py` updated to show both triangular solvers side-by-side. Matches NEC to ~0.1 Ω on R and X at N=160; resolves the "does the Yagi reactance converge to NEC?" question — it does.
- **PR #7** — Interactive inverted-V web UI (FastAPI + Vite/React/TS, under `web/`). WebSocket-driven live solve at sliders for droop angle, halfdriver factor, design freq, measurement freq, N. Smith chart overlay with a debounced ±30% sweep across measurement freq. Canvas shows the wire with current-magnitude color + per-arm `|I|` envelope, scaled by design wavelength with a λ/4 reference bar. No changes to the solver.
- **PR #8** — adds azimuth-plane (xy) far-field polar plot in the top-left of the stage, computed client-side from the segment currents already in the WebSocket response. Shows the figure-8 → fatter-peanut transition as droop closes the V.
- **PR #9** — 2-element Yagi (driver + reflector) added to the interactive UI: geometry tab switcher, per-Yagi controls (driver length factor, reflector length factor, spacing in λ), top-down xy canvas view so the beam axis lives in the far-field cut plane. F/B asymmetry now visible on the azimuth plot.
- **PR #10** — solver perf: dropped `BentTriangularPySim` default `n_qp_off=8 → 4` (free 2× on V, sub-0.02 Ω X error). Added `compute_impedance_swept(k_array)` to both triangular solvers; static kernel + R distances reused across the sweep, only `exp(-jk·R)` and einsum reductions carry a k axis. `/sweep` is ~2× faster, V `/sweep` is ~7× faster overall once combined with the `n_qp_off` change. New `scripts/profile_triangular.py` for future profiling.
- **PR #11** — first C++ accelerator for the triangular solvers: `seg_seg_quad_batch_3d` in `_accelerators.cpp` handles both V's off-edge and Yagi's cross-wire batched quadrature (distinguished by `a²` regularization). OpenMP `parallel for collapse(2)` over `(i, j)` pairs; per-pair `R[q, r]` table is built once and reused across the k axis. The cross-edge/cross-wire block drops from ~190 ms → 4 ms at N=80 (~47×); full V solve goes 250 → 55 ms (~4.6×); V `/sweep` at N=80 goes 3.1 s → 1.7 s (~1.8×). Output verified to ~1e-19 vs numpy. New bottleneck: `_seg_seg_reg_all_batch` (same-edge regularized, still pure numpy).
- **PR #12** — second C++ accelerator: `seg_seg_reg_quad_batch_1d` in `_accelerators.cpp` ports `_seg_seg_reg_all_batch` (same-edge regularized kernel `(exp(-jkR)-1)/(4πR)` on a shared 1D arc). Same `parallel for collapse(2)` + per-pair `R[q,r]` table pattern as PR #11; the kernel is the real-part `cos(kR)-1` plus imag `sin(kR)` directly to match numpy bit-for-bit. Kernel alone is **~14× faster** at typical sizes (numpy 537 → C++ 39 ms at N=80, n_k=41). End-to-end V `/sweep` at N=80, n_k=41 goes **2250 → 982 ms (~2.3×)**; N=40 sweep goes 390 → 211 ms (~1.85×). Output verified to ~1e-14 relative vs numpy. New bottlenecks after PR #12 (on the V `/sweep` workload): (1) numpy einsum / fancy-indexing matrix assembly (item 6e — `compute_impedance_swept` tottime is 488 ms at N=80, 2380 ms at N=160 — *the new dominant cost at N=160*); (2) `numpy.linalg.solve` on the batched `(n_k, M, M)` matrix (item 6d — 609 ms at N=80, 878 ms at N=160). The C++ kernels are now a combined 16% of sweep time.
- **PR #13** — third C++ accelerator: `assemble_Z` in `_accelerators.cpp` ports the scalar/vector-potential matrix assembly that combines J tensors + tangent dot products + `h` into the final `(n_k, n_basis, n_basis)` Z. OpenMP `parallel for collapse(2)` over `(k, m)`; inner `n` loop reads contiguous rows of the J tensors so the inner-loop accesses are sequential (`left_seg`, `right_seg` are simply `m` and `m+1` for V and within-wire for Yagi). Unified kernel — same C++ function serves both `BentTriangularPySim` (per-segment tangents, per-segment h) and `TriangularYagiPySim` (per-wire tangents converted to per-segment). Output matches numpy to ~1e-13 relative. Assembly time alone collapses from **488 → 15 ms at N=80 (~33×)** and **2380 → 36 ms at N=160 (~66×)**. End-to-end speedups: V `/sweep` N=80 goes **1043 → 736 ms (~1.4×)**; V `/sweep` N=160 goes **4207 → 2408 ms (~1.75×)**; Yagi `/sweep` N=80 goes 801 → 560 ms (~1.4×); Yagi `/sweep` N=160 goes 4229 → 3360 ms (~1.26×). After PR #13, **`numpy.linalg.solve` is the new dominant cost** (50% of V `/sweep` at N=80, **60% at N=160**) — item 6d is now the top remaining bottleneck. A smaller next-tier cost has emerged: `np.zeros_like` on the (n_k, N, N) J tensors (~145 ms / 7% at N=160), driven by the ~270 MB of memory it has to touch.
- **PR #14** — web UI freq band tightened from ±30% around 13.625 MHz to 0.8x–1.25x around 14.3 MHz; freq sliders narrowed to match the sweep band (and the measurement freq slider now derives min/max from designFreq so it tracks the sweep endpoints exactly). UI only — no solver changes.
- **PR #15** — PyNEC (NEC2 via [python-necpp](https://github.com/tmolteno/python-necpp)) added as an optional second backend for the web UI. Vendored as a submodule at `python-necpp/` (the PyPI wheel build is broken on Py 3.14; the submodule + `scripts/build_pynec.sh` produces a working install). New `web/pynec_backend.py` mirrors the pysim solve/sweep response shape for both inverted V and Yagi geometries; the server dispatches via a `solver` field on each request (`"pysim"` or `"pynec"`), and the frontend adds a tab in the simulation panel. At N=30 single-frequency solves: PyNEC ~0.8 ms vs pysim ~6 ms (~7.5×); at N=160 PyNEC ~13 ms vs pysim ~50 ms (~4×). Z agreement is ~1 Ω across both antennas. The animation rate isn't actually limited by the solver in either case — the bottleneck is WebSocket round-trip + render. Note: PyNEC's hand-rolled C++ LU solver doesn't link BLAS at all (`./configure --without-lapack`); patching upstream to call `zgetrf`/`zgetrs` is plausible future work that would help at large N.

- **PR #35** — Fan dipole geometry on the PyNEC backend. `_build_fandipole` / `solve_fandipole` produce a K-band cone arrangement (default 2 bands at 20m + 10m) with K arm wires per side meeting at a shared T→S feed gap; PyNEC handles the wire-endpoint junctions natively via shared segment coordinates. UI: new "Fan dipole" tab with sliders for n_bands (1–5), per-band length, cone slope, cone radius; meas-band tab strip parallel to design-band strip so the user can probe each band without retuning; meas-freq slider expanded to the full HF range for fan_dipole and sweep anchored to measFreq so the Smith plot follows the band; in-flight sweep aborts immediately on any slider move so the live /ws solve isn't starved by a stale streaming sweep. Side-view (yz) projection in the antenna canvas. Bug fix to `_segment_centers_to_knot_currents`: added `junction_at_start/end` flags so band-arm inner-knot currents carry the adjacent segment value instead of the open-wire zero — without it the envelope tapered to nothing at the feed-side junction.

- **PR #36** — Junction support in `TriangularPySim` + fan dipole on pysim. New `junctions=[[(wire_idx, "start"|"end"), ...], ...]` constructor arg. Each junction adds K directional tent bases (one per (wire, end) tuple) with the single active wing on the adjacent segment, level 1 at the junction node falling to 0 at the segment's other end. KCL Σ I_k = 0 is enforced symmetrically by a Lagrange-multiplier row per junction (+1 for "start", −1 for "end" matching the outflow sign), so no privileged reference wire is picked. The Z assembly is refactored around per-basis `(seg, L_left, R_right)` support arrays — the new general path handles arbitrary 2-wing layouts including the inactive-wing case for junction directionals. Non-junction geometries take the existing fast path with the C++ accelerator and are bit-exact regressions. `web/server.py` ships `_solve_fandipole` / `_sweep_fandipole` using TriangularPySim with the 2-segment-feed-wire trick (puts an interior knot at the midpoint of T→S so the delta-gap source has a place to live), and the "fan_dipole requires PyNEC" route is gone — the UI's solver-tab toggle works end-to-end. **Known**: 2-band fan dipole on pysim disagrees with PyNEC by ~14 Ω real at the 14.3 MHz design freq. K=2 junctions match the single-polyline equivalent to roundoff (verifying the formulation), but K=3 with sharp angles surfaces a gap — see new item 8 and item 12 in "What's left" for what's known about it and how to chase it.

- **PR #37** — Three improvements to the triangular solver's batched path, primarily targeting multi-band fan-dipole `/sweep` performance:
  1. **6g: `assemble_Z_general` C++ accelerator.** Ports `_assemble_Z_general_batch` (the per-basis `(support_seg, support_L, support_R)` 2-wing assembly used for junction geometries) to C++, mirroring PR #13's `parallel for collapse(2)` over `(k, m)`. Slope = (R − L) / h is precomputed once outside the parallel region; junction directional bases with one inactive wing (L=R=0) pass through the same kernel without a branch. Kernel: **5286 → 45 ms at n_per_wire=21, n_k=41 (~117×)**, exceeding the 33–66× estimate. Bit-exact with the pure-Python reference to 3.3e-16 relative.
  2. **6h: J-build dispatch fusion.** Replaces `_build_J_blocks(_batch)`'s ~150 small per-edge-pair Python dispatches with one all-pairs `seg_seg_quad_batch_3d` call, then per-edge overwrites the same-edge blocks with the analytic + regularized treatment. Same-edge pairs are computed twice (~5% redundant compute) but the dispatch savings dominate. `_build_J_blocks_batch` **593 → 224 ms (~2.65×)** at fan-dipole sizes.
  3. **6i: Schur-complement KCL solve.** Replaces `_solve_with_kcl_batch`'s `(n_k, n_b+n_c, n_b+n_c)` augmented-matrix construction with a Schur complement: solve `Z [w | X] = [v | Aᵀ]` (batched, 1 + n_c RHS), then `S λ = A w` (tiny n_c × n_c), `coeffs = w − X λ`. Avoids materializing the augmented (41, 425, 425) matrix entirely — that construction alone cost ~63 ms / 12% of /sweep. Numerically equivalent to ~6e-15 relative. Saves ~50 ms / ~7% e2e on fan-dipole. Also applied to single-k `_solve_with_kcl` for consistency.

  **Cumulative end-to-end speedup on 5-band fan-dipole `/sweep` (n=21, n_k=41): 6067 → ~750 ms (~8×)** across the three items. Inverted V and Yagi geometries (few edges, no junctions) are unaffected by 6h and 6i; only 6g touches their path, and they didn't use the general assembly anyway, so end-to-end is unchanged.

  After PR #37, the wall-time breakdown on the 5-band fan dipole `/sweep` is roughly: J build ~50%, batched solve (Schur) ~30%, assembly ~10%, glue ~10%. **J build is the dominant cost on all geometries**; see item 6b for the next remaining lever (vectorized libmvec → SLEEF/SVML for AVX-512 sincos).

  New regression tests: `test_assemble_Z_general_cpp_matches_python` (bit-exact C++ vs python on a K=3 junction) and `test_triangular_fandipole_swept_matches_per_freq` (batched-vs-per-freq for K=3, mirroring the existing K=2 test). The Schur-complement change is covered by the existing `test_triangular_k2_junction_*` and `test_triangular_fandipole_two_band_smoke` tests.

- **PR #44** — `SinusoidalPySim`: from-scratch NEC2 three-term basis solver alongside `TriangularPySim` (default unchanged). Built from the LLNL theory manual (`docs/nec2_theory_manual.pdf`, design memo in `docs/sinusoidal_basis_design.md`), not from the necpp source. Scope: free space, thin-wire kernel, delta-gap, uniform radius, X_i=0 free-end. Straight-dipole result: 69.63 − j18.26 at N=101 vs NEC2 reference 69.64 − j18.21. Hentenna params_50: reproduces PyNEC R+jX to ~0.05 Ω across n=15..281, establishing that the hentenna X drift is intrinsic to the three-term basis (see item 14 for the full sweep and what it does/doesn't settle).

- **PR #45** — `BSplinePySim`: degree-d B-spline Galerkin MoM solver (currently d ∈ {1, 2}) alongside `TriangularPySim` and `SinusoidalPySim`. Polynomial-per-segment basis with the same multi-wire / polyline / K-wire-junction / KCL machinery as `TriangularPySim`. Closed-form same-edge static-kernel moment integrals J_pq for p, q ∈ {0..2} sympy-derived once and dumped to `_bspline_static_moments.py` (no runtime sympy dependency; re-run `scripts/derive_bspline_static_moments.py` with a larger `MAX_D` to extend to higher degrees). Same-edge moments split as analytic static + GL-quadrature smooth-kernel — essential because direct GL converges only logarithmically on the 1/R diagonal. Scope: free space, thin-wire kernel, delta-gap, uniform radius, no C++ accelerator yet (pure-numpy J build and Z assembly). **Hentenna params_50 arbitration result (this is the load-bearing finding)**: at every n probed (15, 21, 41, 81), `BSplinePySim(degree=2)` lands at 43.05 + j38.84 ± 0.01 Ω — *the same Z as `TriangularPySim`* (~43.13 + j38.79 at n=81), with the d=2 basis actually converging *faster* (already at j38.85 by n=15 vs d=1's j37.14). Two independent basis families (d=1 tent, d=2 quadratic — different polynomial degrees, different code paths, different polynomial-moment integrals) converge to the same value. **Settles items 9, 13, 14**: pysim's tent basis is NOT converged-to-the-wrong-place; NEC2's three-term basis is the outlier that drifts super-logarithmically on this geometry. Verified on dipole (69.64 - j18.17 at N=81 vs NEC ref 69.64 - j18.21), 2-element Yagi (agrees with `TriangularPySim` ~0.2 Ω at N=21), and 30° V-dipole polyline (agrees ~0.3 Ω at N=40). New regression test `test_bspline_d2_hentenna_arbitrates_against_triangular` pins the value and the cross-basis agreement.

- **PR #46** — Templated C++ accelerators for `BSplinePySim`: J kernel + static moments + Z assembly. Pure-numpy reference path retained as fall-back; bit-exact regression tests cover both. Brings B-spline single-k solve into the same speed class as Triangular's accelerated path.

- **PR #47** — Singular-basis enrichment at K≥3 junctions for `BSplinePySim`: opt-in `use_singular_enrichment=True` kwarg adds a Φ_sing(u) = (u/h)·log(u/h) basis on each segment adjacent to a K≥enrichment_min_k=3 junction. The basis vanishes at the junction node (matching the finite-current condition) while its derivative has the log singularity that captures the classical K≥3 junction charge-density behaviour. On hentenna-class geometries this flips the R-rate from O(1/N) → ~O(1/N^(d+1)) (basis-limited). C++ `assemble_Z_enrich` accelerator handles the augmented (Z_pp, Z_pe, Z_ep, Z_ee) assembly.

- **PR #48** — Smoothed delta-gap source for `BSplinePySim`: opt-in `feed_smoothing_factor=α` replaces V·δ(s − s_f) with V·g_w(s − s_f) where g_w is a cos² bump of integral 1 and half-width w/2 = α·h_feed/2. Galerkin RHS becomes ⟨Φ_m, g_w(. − s_f)⟩, computed by Gauss-Legendre on the bump's support. Eliminates the log-singular feed-point current that caps delta-gap convergence at O(1/N) regardless of basis degree — smoothed-source convergence is basis-limited (O(1/N³) for d=2). Helps dipoles; orthogonal to PR #47's K≥3 enrichment (both are opt-in independent fixes for different convergence caps).

- **PR #49** — Multi-backend solver UI. Three configurable slots A/B/C on the controls panel, each carrying its own backend choice (Triangular / Sinusoidal / B-spline / PyNEC) + segments/wire + wire radius + model-specific knobs (n_qp_reg/n_qp_off, n_qp_const, degree, n_qp_pair, feed_smoothing_factor, use_singular_enrichment, n_qp_sing, enrichment_min_k, n_qp_source). Per-slot gear menu opens a modal with the backend picker plus all options. Defaults A=Triangular N=40, B=B-spline d=2 N=21 with K≥3 enrichment, C=PyNEC N=41. Server dispatches via `pysim_model` + `model_options` filtered through per-model allowlists; `currents_at_knots(coeffs)` added to all three pysim model classes so the web response carries per-knot complex currents regardless of basis convention. Sinusoidal and B-spline get a `compute_impedance_swept` loop fallback so `/sweep` works for all three.

- **PR #50** — PEC image-method ground for `BSplinePySim` and `SinusoidalPySim`, mirroring the existing TriangularPySim implementation. B-spline: image segments mirrored across z=ground_z, image-tangent dot product applied to flip the horizontal current direction, image J integrals via the standard off-edge full-kernel quadrature, image Z block subtracted from free-space Z; `_assemble_Z` grew an optional td_all override so the same assembly fuses the image-current sign flip. Sinusoidal: `_field_tensor` grew optional `src_centers` / `src_tangents` so the same tangential-field formula computes the image-source field at the original observer points; `_assemble_Z` subtracts image-source Φ tensors before the basis-coefficient sweep. Server `_make_pysim_sim` forwards `ground_z` to all three pysim models; frontend `backendSupportsGround()` enables the ground checkbox on the new slots. Pairing `use_singular_enrichment + ground_z` is rejected at construction (the enrichment-basis image reaction isn't worked out yet); the frontend silently drops enrichment from the request when both are active. Cross-validated on a horizontal dipole at h=7m, N=40: Tri/Sin/BSpl all agree on R within 0.5 Ω and X within 1 Ω.

- **PR #51** — **Sign-bug fix in `assemble_Z_enrich`**: the C++ accelerator stored `dΦ_sing/du_arc = (log(u_norm) + 1)/h` for every enrichment basis, but for orig=1 ("end"-orientation: junction at the segment's right endpoint, u_norm = 1 − t) the chain rule requires du_norm/du_arc = −1/h, so dΦ/du_arc should be negated. The missing sign poisoned the Φ-piece of Z_pe / Z_ep and the mixed-orig off-diagonals of Z_ee. On hentenna-like geometries where mirror K=3 junctions have opposite orig, the bug broke left-right symmetry: at N=21 with enrichment, the upper-end enrichment coefficient at D was 6.6× its upper-start mirror at B; impedance was Z = 42.85 + j44.24 (incorrect). With the fix it's 43.05 + j39.13 — within 0.4 Ω of slot A's Triangular N=40 baseline, and per-knot |I| values across the L-R mirror are now bit-exact equal. Surfaced from a UI report of a visible kink in the left-vertical |I| envelope on hentenna's upper polyline that the right vertical didn't show. New regression test `test_bspline_hentenna_enrichment_left_right_symmetry` pins the exact symmetry at N=21 in <1s; the existing pinned-impedance test for the same geometry moved its values to the corrected ones and switched its convergence-rate fit from R to X (R now hits the few-mΩ noise floor between N=41 and N=81). **Re-opens items 9 / 13 / 14 / item 15 below**: the arbitration value of 43.05 + j38.84 from PR #45 was computed with the buggy sign — the corrected enrichment-on convergence story needs a re-run. *(Closed in the post-#51 re-evaluation — see item 15's table below: the 43.05 + j38.84 asymptote is reconfirmed by the polynomial trio (tri / b2 / b2e). `SinusoidalPySim` continues to track PyNEC's super-log drift as expected (same three-term basis family). d=2-no-enrich was never affected by the bug; d=2-enrich now converges to the same place.)*

- **PR #52** — Closes NEXT_STEPS items 11 / 15(a-d) / 16: post-PR-#51 enrichment re-eval (three new probe scripts + 5-column hentenna sweep + arbitration-test tolerance tighten). Same PR also fixes a σ-handling bug in `SinusoidalPySim.currents_at_knots` that broke L-R symmetry on the hentenna canvas — `currents_at_knots` was multiplying the whole `(A + B·sin + C·cos)` basis evaluation by σ instead of using the `(σA, B, σC)` effective coefficients that `_assemble_Z` uses, which doubled the sin term at σ=−1 junction neighbours. Impedance was unaffected (compute_impedance evaluates at s=0). Regression test `test_sinusoidal_hentenna_left_right_symmetry` pins <1e-12 cross-mirror agreement.

- **Slot-B default flip (this branch)** — Web UI's slot B (`BSplinePySim` d=2 N=21) flips from `use_singular_enrichment=true` to `false` (i.e. inherits the backend default), based on the K=3 junction current-imbalance probe (`scripts/probe_k3_junction_imbalance.py`). The probe measures `tap_ratio = min(|I|)/max(|I|)` across the three wires meeting at each K=3 junction:

  ```
  geometry            tap ratio   normalized magnitudes   character
  ------------------  ----------  ----------------------  -----------------------
  fan dipole at S/T      0.03    (1.00, 0.99, 0.03)      basically K=2 + dead 10m
  hentenna  at B/D       0.16    (1.00, 0.84, 0.16)      dominant pair + small tap
  Y-fixture at S         0.50    (1.00, 0.50, 0.50)      balanced 3-way (2:1:1)
  ```

  The diagnostic: **when current at a K=3 junction collapses to a dominant in/out pair with the third wire as a small tap, the log-singular charge-density cusp is suppressed and enrichment is a no-op** (hentenna, fan dipole). When the split is genuinely 3-way (Y-fixture), the cusp matters and enrichment shifts Z by 0.08 Ω on R — the value the d=1 tent basis converges to independently. Both UI K=3 antennas (hentenna, fan dipole) live in the dominant-pair regime, so flipping the default loses no accuracy on any shipped preset and saves 0.26 Ω X accuracy on hentenna at n=21 (the 15(a) finding). Users hitting a genuinely 3-way K=3 geometry can flip enrichment back on via the slot's gear menu.

## What's left

Ordered by what I'd actually do next, not by what's most ambitious.

### High value, moderate effort

1. ~~**Multi-wire `TriangularYagiPySim`**~~ — done in PR #5. Driver impedance converges to NEC within ~0.1 Ω on R and X at N=160.

2. ~~**Add the triangular solver to `scripts/compare_yagi_nec.py`**~~ — done in PR #5. Both `TriangularPySim` and `TriangularYagiPySim` are now printed side-by-side with NEC for both dipole and Yagi cases.

3. ~~**Investigate observed `TriangularPySim` convergence rate**~~ — investigated in [scripts/triangular_convergence.py](scripts/triangular_convergence.py). Findings: hypothesis (a) [odd-N off-center source] is **wrong** — at any given N, odd-N actually produces a *smaller* absolute error than the adjacent even N (for `point_delta` it's strictly better on the real part, identical on imag). The log-log slope difference between even and odd just reflects different small-N transients, not different asymptotic rates: at N≥80 both parities converge at ~O(1/N^1.2). Hypothesis (b) [delta-gap source projection] is the real cap: switching to a finite-gap source (`finite_gap` in the convergence script) barely changes the rate, only the asymptotic limit, indicating the convergence cap is from the delta-gap *physics* (singular feed-point current), not from the projection method. Conclusion: the right next move for higher accuracy is a magnetic-frill / true finite-gap source — i.e., item 5.

### Medium value, larger effort

4. ~~**Bent wire / arbitrary geometry support for `TriangularPySim`**~~ — done as `BentTriangularPySim` in `src/pysim/triangular_bent.py`. Accepts an arbitrary 3D polyline. Same-edge segment pairs reuse the analytic static-kernel extraction from `TriangularPySim`; cross-edge pairs use wire-radius-regularized 3D Gauss-Legendre quadrature. Per-segment tangents enter the vector-potential assembly via per-sub-rectangle dot products. Validated against NEC for V-dipoles across α∈{0, 15, 30, 45, 60}° — sub-0.3 Ω agreement up to 30° bend, ~5% relative at 60°. *Multi-wire bent geometry (bent Yagi etc.) is a natural follow-up — the same `BentTriangularPySim` scaffolding generalizes by adding wire-boundary tracking like `TriangularYagiPySim`.*

5. ~~**Magnetic-frill or finite-gap feed model**~~ — **investigated and reverted**; null result documented here. Implementation lived briefly on the `magnetic-frill-feed` branch (commits `dbbc300` … reverted) and was a working Tsai/Burke-Poggio coaxial-feed model (`feed_model="magnetic_frill"`, `frill_outer_factor=2.3` for a ~50 Ω feed, matching NEC2's default). Source vector built by analytic DC-kernel projection of `E_z(z) = +V/(2 ln(b/a)) · [exp(−jkR1)/R1 − exp(−jkR2)/R2]` against the linear tent (asinh / sqrt antiderivatives — required because the `1/R` part is sharply peaked inside `|z| ≲ b ≈ 1 mm` while segments at typical N are ~65 mm, far too wide for moderate-nq Gauss-Legendre to resolve) plus a smooth-remainder GL quadrature for the k-dependent `(exp(−jkR)−1)/R` part. Sign was chosen so the b→a limit recovers the delta-gap convention v[m_center]=1; verified by `sum(v) = 1.0` to 1e-8 in the k→0 limit.

   **Why we reverted.** At pysim's typical discretizations the projected source vector spreads only ~1% of its mass onto each immediate neighbor of `m_center` and concentrates the rest there — and *after the matrix solve* this distinction in v washes out almost entirely:
   - Half-wave dipole, N=81 → `|Z_frill − Z_delta| < 0.01 Ω`
   - Short dipole (0.15 λ), N=161 → still ~1 Ω, while both differ from PyNEC by ~12 Ω
   - Convergence rate unchanged: both feed models track at ~O(1/N^0.77) toward PyNEC; the residual is the formulation gap (extended thin-wire kernel etc.), not the source
   - Cost when enabled: +30–120% on `compute_impedance` (Python loop over n_b × 2 wings dominates; ~30 ms / 45 ms `_build_source_vector` overhead at N=160 single / swept-41)

   **The valuable finding — preserved here.** The fan-dipole's ~14 Ω disagreement with PyNEC (item 8) is **not** the feed model. Both pysim feed models give nearly the same Z at the relevant N because h >> b, so the tent basis can't resolve the frill's width and the matrix-solved current responds the same way. This cheaply rules out one whole class of explanation and points to item 12 (cross-wire kernel regularization at the K=3 junction) as the next leverage point — the cone-angle sweep evidence already implicates it.

   **If we ever want it back.** The implementation is in git history at commit `dbbc300`. The frill matters in regimes pysim doesn't currently exercise: N > ~1000 where the delta-gap reactance starts to drift logarithmically (the legacy pulse-basis convergence-failure mode, milder for tent basis but still present), and very-short antennas where the feed-singularity-vs-finite-source distinction is larger relative to |Z|. Re-applying would also benefit from vectorizing the Python loop (the analytic-DC + GL-remainder math is fully vectorizable across bases — drop the per-basis Python dispatch to single-digit-ms overhead).

6. **C++ accelerator: remaining work after PR #37.** Phases 1, 2, 3, and 4 landed: cross-edge/cross-wire quadrature (PR #11), same-edge regularized quadrature (PR #12), Z matrix assembly fast path (PR #13), and Z matrix assembly general path + J-build fusion + Schur KCL solve for junction geometries (PR #37). The wall-time breakdown on the 5-band fan dipole `/sweep` is now roughly: J build ~50% (kernel-bound on AVX2 sincos), batched solve ~25%, assembly ~10%, glue ~15%. Items below are organized by what's actionable; deep micro-optimization of the C++ kernels (item 6b) is *blocked on this development machine* (i7-8550U, Kaby Lake R — AVX/AVX2 + FMA only, no AVX-512). If pysim deploys to a server with AVX-512 the calculus changes; for now the leverage is elsewhere.

   **Done:**

   - ~~**6g. assemble_Z for junction geometries.**~~ — done in PR #37. `_assemble_Z_general_batch` collapses from 5286 ms → 45 ms at n_per_wire=21, n_k=41 (~117×); end-to-end fan-dipole /sweep 6067 → 971 ms (~6.25×). Bit-exact with the pure-Python reference to 3.3e-16 relative.

   - ~~**6h. J-build batching for junction multi-edge geometries.**~~ — done in PR #37. `_build_J_blocks(_batch)` fused into one all-pairs `seg_seg_quad_batch_3d` call plus per-edge same-edge overwrites with the analytic+regularized treatment. Same-edge pairs are computed twice (the off-edge quadrature is wrong for them, then overwritten) but ~5% redundant compute is paid back many times over by eliminating ~150 small Python-side dispatches. `_build_J_blocks_batch` 593 → 224 ms (~2.65×); end-to-end fan-dipole /sweep 971 → 641 ms (~1.5×). Inverted V and Yagi (few edges, ~no dispatch overhead) unaffected.

   - ~~**6i. Schur-complement KCL solve.**~~ — done in PR #37. The KCL-augmented `(n_k, n_b+n_c, n_b+n_c)` matrix construction in `_solve_with_kcl_batch` was costing ~63 ms (12% of fan-dipole /sweep) just to allocate and write the augmented matrix M. Replaced with the Schur complement: solve `Z [w | X] = [v | A.T]` (batched, 1+n_c=3 RHS) then `S λ = A w` (tiny n_c × n_c per k), `coeffs = w − X λ`. Avoids materializing M entirely. Numerically equivalent (~6e-15 relative). Save ~50 ms / ~7% e2e on fan dipole.

   **Remaining work, re-ranked for AVX2-only hardware:**

   - **6d. Batched LU solve via direct LAPACK + OpenMP over k.** *Now the biggest actionable lever.* Post-PR-#37, `np.linalg.solve` is ~25% of fan-dipole /sweep (~180 ms) and ~18% on inverted V N=80 (~31 ms). VTune showed `blas_thread_server` accumulating ~48 thread-seconds — most of it OpenBLAS workers spinning while idle, contending with the C++ kernels' OpenMP threads for cores. The (n_k=41, M=423) shape is awkward for OpenBLAS: each k's `zgetrf`+`zgetrs` is small enough that the inner BLAS parallelism gives little benefit while the thread-pool overhead is large. A direct `zgetrf` + `zgetrs` from C++ with `parallel for` over k (and OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 inside the LAPACK calls to prevent nested threading) should give near-linear scaling on this shape. Estimated 2-3× on the solve, hence ~1.15-1.25× end-to-end. Implementation: add `solve_kcl_batched` to `_accelerators.cpp` calling LAPACK directly (link `-llapack` or use scipy.linalg.lapack which exposes the same routines without a build dependency).

   - **6j. Runtime BLAS thread cap.** *Easiest win, low effort.* VTune confirms that the default `OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=8` (or whatever it picks via openblas-pthreads autodetect) gives 8 OpenBLAS workers spinning to serve a few small solves while 8 OpenMP threads run the C++ kernels — pure contention on this 4-physical-core CPU. An OMP × BLAS thread sweep on 5-band fan dipole showed: defaults give ~825 ms, while `OMP=8 BLAS=4` gives ~711 ms (~14% faster), and `OMP=4 BLAS=1` (current shell default) gives ~812 ms. Best is `OMP=physical_cores BLAS=physical_cores/2` for our (n_k=41, M~400) regime. Could set this at import time in `pysim/__init__.py` (using `threadpoolctl`) or document as a deployment knob.

   - **6c. OpenMP scaling at higher N.** At N=80 the per-`(i, j)` work is small enough that OpenMP scheduling overhead dominates beyond ~4 threads (best at T=2–4 in measurements). At N=160+ this should self-correct since work per thread grows quadratically; revisit once we have an actual workload at that scale.

   - **6k. Optional single-precision (`float32`) pipeline.** Trades accuracy for 2× SIMD lane width — on AVX2 this is the *only* way to widen the math beyond what libmvec already does, since AVX-512 is blocked (item 6b). Tiered options, each strictly extending the previous:
     1. **Sincos only in float32** (cast in/out): ~12% e2e. Per-element cos/sin error ~1e-5 abs (was ~1e-15). J integrals ~2e-6 relative. Low risk.
     2. **Full float32 inner loop, double accumulators**: ~17% e2e. Cast overhead at accumulator boundary eats ~30% of the gain. J integrals still ~2e-6.
     3. **Full float32 J kernel (incl. accumulators)**: ~22-25% e2e. J integrals ~1e-6, final Z error ~0.1 Ω on 50 Ω antennas — same order as existing pysim-vs-NEC discretization error.
     4. **Also float32 in `np.linalg.solve` (`cgesv` instead of `zgesv`)**: another ~10-12% e2e (solve is currently 25% of /sweep, single-complex LU is ~2× faster).
     5. **Also float32 assembly (`assemble_Z_general`)**: another ~5% e2e (assembly is only 10% of /sweep).

     **Cumulative ceiling on AVX2: ~35-40% e2e** for the full-stack float32 mode. Existing tests would fail at every tier: `test_assemble_Z_general_cpp_matches_python` rtol=1e-12 (tier ≥1), `test_triangular_k2_junction_*` atol=1e-9 (tier ≥3), `test_triangular_fandipole_swept_matches_per_freq` atol=1e-6 (tier ≥3). Design implication: add `precision="float"` (or similar) opt-in flag, gate the C++ kernels on it, keep double as default. Existing tests stay; add float32 regression tests with relaxed tolerances (atol ~1e-3 on Z). Suited for the interactive web UI where the user can already see a ~0.1 Ω disagreement between pysim and PyNEC without complaint.

   - **6l. BSpline `seg_seg_full_moments_bspline_kernel` has an un-vectorized scalar sincos.** *AVX2-applicable, not hardware-blocked.* A cross-engine `perf` profile (single-thread, hentenna N=21 width sweep via `scripts/vtune_hentenna_width_sweep.py --solver {sin,tri,bspline}`) measured the sin/cos share of total self-time per engine:

     | engine | hot kernel | libmvec SIMD sincos | scalar sincos | total sincos |
     |---|---|---|---|---|
     | sinusoidal | `sinusoidal_field_tensor` | 10.2% | 0.3% | 10.5% |
     | triangular | `seg_seg_quad_batch_3d` | 7.7% | — | 7.7% |
     | bspline | `seg_seg_full_moments_bspline_kernel` | 3.0% | **1.4% (`__sincos_fma`)** | 4.4% |

     The bspline kernel is the only one of the three that still spends a meaningful chunk (~⅓ of its sincos, 1.4% of total runtime) in *scalar* libm `__sincos_fma` rather than the vectorized libmvec `_ZGVdN4v_{sin,cos}` path — some phase/sincos site in the d-templated kernel isn't inside an `omp simd` loop over a contiguous phase buffer. The lever is the same flat-buffer batching the sinusoidal kernel already uses (Stage A/B/C in `sinusoidal_field_tensor`): collect all phases into one array, run a single split cos/sin `omp simd` sweep, then assemble. Ceiling is small (~1.4% e2e on bspline) — file it as cleanup-grade, not a priority.

     **Note on the f32-8-way idea (was item 6k tier 1, now declined for sincos):** the f32 mode was prototyped on `sinusoidal_field_tensor` (`PYSIM_SINCOS_MODE=1/2`) and **measured as no help even in sinusoidal — the engine with the *most* sincos (10.5%)** — because the float↔double conversions and Cody-Waite reduction eat the theoretical ~½× SIMD-width win. Since triangular (7.7%) and bspline (4.4%) have strictly less sincos, their f32 ceilings are even lower (~3.8% / ~1.5%), so f32-8-way sincos is not worth carrying on any engine. The prototype was stripped; the f64 4-way flat-buffer restructuring it rode in on was kept (it *is* the sinusoidal sincos win).

   **Blocked on this hardware:**

   - **6b. Vectorized `cexp(-jkR)` via SLEEF / Intel SVML for AVX-512 sincos.** *Blocked: i7-8550U has no AVX-512.* The C++ quadrature kernels already use libmvec's AVX2 `cos_avx2`/`sin_avx2` (4 doubles per inst), which is the widest sincos this CPU supports. AVX-512 (8 doubles per inst) would notionally give ~1.5-2× on the sincos portion (~22% of J build, ~10% of /sweep), but only on Skylake-X / Ice Lake / Tiger Lake / newer server parts. If pysim deploys to such hardware, this becomes the top lever; on Kaby Lake there is nothing to gain. Smaller AVX2 micro-opts (fused sincos via SLEEF — libmvec lacks vector sincos so cos and sin are two passes; software pipelining the kernel loop) are plausible but add a build dependency for an estimated <10% kernel speedup.

   **Retired:**

   - ~~**6f. `np.zeros_like` on the J tensors.**~~ — obsolete after PR #37. The fused J-build no longer pre-allocates J tensors in Python (the C++ kernel allocates them directly as its output).

   The natural API target remains the *batched* form: each kernel function takes `k_array` and produces `(n_k, N, N)` output. The Python paths should remain as the reference / fallback for platforms without OpenMP. Existing `seg_seg_quad_batch_3d`, `seg_seg_reg_quad_batch_1d`, `assemble_Z`, and `assemble_Z_general` are the pybind11 build templates.

### Validation

7. **Coverage for non-default geometries** — sweep `wavelength`, `halfdriver_factor`, `wire_radius`, verify `TriangularPySim` against NEC. Currently only the default (0.481 λ) dipole has been validated end-to-end.

8. ~~**Third-reference validation**~~ — **resolved with a refinement**. The 2-band fan-dipole disagreement between `TriangularPySim` and PyNEC originally looked like ~14 Ω on R AND ~15 Ω on X, but the X gap was a **geometry artifact**: the old `_FANDIPOLE_RING_5` constant placed K=2 bands at lopsided pentagon positions (36° and 108°, only 72° apart on one side of the cone) rather than at the natural opposite ends of a diameter. After replacing the static prefix with `_fandipole_ring(K)` that distributes K bands evenly at 360°/K (`fandipole-even-ring` branch), the X gap collapses to ~1.5 Ω across N and the only remaining axis is R.

   `scripts/compare_fandipole_solvers.py` 3-way comparison at n_bands=2 (the K=3 junction case), 14.3 MHz design freq, with the corrected even-distribution ring:

   ```
     N |    pysim (R + jX)    |    PyNEC (R + jX)    | pymininec (R + jX)
    21 |   +58.9   -5.3j      |   +51.6   -3.9j      |   +58.8   -5.8j
    41 |   +59.0   -4.9j      |   +49.1   -3.5j      |   +58.5  -11.8j
    81 |   +59.1   -4.6j      |   +46.8   -3.1j      |   +56.9  -34.9j
   ```

   pysim and pymininec — two independently-implemented MoM solvers in different basis families (triangular Galerkin vs pulse) — **agree on R to ~2 Ω across N**. PyNEC's R drifts downward with N (51.6 → 46.8, a further 4.8 Ω drift from N=21→81). The gap to pysim/pymininec is ~7 Ω at N=21 and ~12 Ω at N=81. The X gap is now small in all three solvers. pymininec's X diverges with N as documented (pulse-basis convergence-failure mode), so only its R is useful — R agreement with pysim across N is the load-bearing evidence.

   **Decision**: accept the remaining R disagreement as a known NEC2-vs-others formulation gap and move on. Pysim is not the outlier — NEC2 is. The literature attributes this to NEC2's source-at-K-wire-junction handling and the thin-wire-kernel choice (these caveats apply independent of wire diameter, which is uniform in our model — that ruled out the dissimilar-diameter literature concerns). NEC4 is *not* a useful arbiter here: it shares NEC2's pulse-ish basis, delta-gap source, and thin-wire kernel for normal-radius wires, and the literature finds NEC4 vs NEC2 differences of <5 Ω for free-space wire antennas with uniform diameter. A genuinely independent arbiter would need a different formulation: higher-order B-spline in pysim (item 9 — cheapest in-codebase path), FDTD, or a surface-MoM with RWG basis.

   **Implication for the web UI**: the "solver agreement diagnostic" idea in item 10 should now treat fan-dipole pysim/PyNEC R disagreement as expected (and *growing* with K and N), not a bug indicator. The X agreement is the new baseline.

13. **Hentenna cross-solver convergence — pysim converges, PyNEC diverges super-logarithmically.** Per-solver convergence sweep on the single-band hentenna at params_50 (28.47 MHz, free-space, r=0.5 mm, uniform N segments per non-feed edge). Feed-wire segment count chosen per backend so the source sits at the geometric centre of the T→S gap: EVEN for pysim (tent-basis interior knot at z=0) and ODD for PyNEC (delta-gap segment centred on z=0). The parity choice biases R by ~1 Ω in PyNEC and X by ~0.04 Ω in pysim if mismatched — both small but worth being right.

    ```

    ```

    Pysim is stable to 3 sig figs from n=80 onward, locked at ~43.13 + j38.91 (a hint of upward R drift at very large n — 43.13 at n=80, 43.15 at n=661 — likely segment-radius interaction on the pysim side). PyNEC does *not* asymptote: `dX/d(log n)` increases monotonically across the sweep (3.5 at n=15→21, 12.1 at n=201→281, 23.8 at n=601→661 — never constant or decreasing), so the growth is super-logarithmic. The earlier framing "PyNEC is heading toward pysim's converged value" was sloppy — the trend would *cross* +j38.91 only if it kept going indefinitely past it, and it appears to. At the last feasible n (661, just before the cross-bar at 0.676 m / r=0.5 mm hits NEC's segment ≥ 2·radius rule), PyNEC X = +j29.01, still ~10 Ω below pysim and accelerating.

    **Third-solver corroboration on the canonical M-Hentenna (W=λ/6, H=λ/2, feed at λ/10).** Babli/Yannopoulou/Zimourtopoulos ([viXra:1811.0473](https://vixra.org/abs/1811.0473)) report R ≈ 65 Ω, X ≈ 0 Ω at the M-Hentenna's design freq, using Richmond's RICHWIRE (piecewise-sinusoidal MoM at OSU, [Richmond 1974](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA015377)) — a completely independent code lineage from NEC. Re-running our pysim at the paper's r/λ ≈ 0.0037 scaling: pysim gives 66.75 + j6.0 (R within 2 Ω of RICHWIRE; X near zero), stable across n=12..161. PyNEC can't directly run the paper's geometry — at r/λ ≈ 0.0037 with W=λ/6, the cross-bar fails NEC's segment ≥ 2·radius rule for any n ≥ ~9. So **pysim's basis is corroborated by RICHWIRE on M-Hentenna**, but this only carries over to params_50 by argument — they share the topology, not the dimensions. The paper measured *patterns* in an anechoic chamber, not impedance — no physical Z ground-truth was found in any of the open hentenna literature surveyed (OE9HRV field report, DK7ZB page, portable-antennas.com, the 1982 QST article reference, the 1996 Kinoshita reference; none publish a measured R+jX).

    Likely interpretation: this is the same "imag part diverges with N" pathology already documented for the legacy pulse-basis pysim in [docs/convergence_analysis.md](docs/convergence_analysis.md), surfacing in PyNEC on the hentenna's particular geometry. **Which solver is physically correct remains unsettled** — pysim being converged and PyNEC being non-convergent doesn't automatically make pysim right; pysim's converged value could still reflect a systematic error in the tent basis that doesn't show up as non-convergence (it would just converge to the wrong place). NEC4 is *not* a useful arbiter (same MoM family, same pulse-ish basis, same delta-gap, same thin-wire kernel — literature has NEC2/NEC4 differing by <5 Ω on free-space wire antennas, much smaller than the 10 Ω residual here). What would arbitrate is a method in a fundamentally different formulation: see "What's open" below.

    **Feed-model probe (the same Tsai magnetic-frill from item 5, re-applied on the hentenna).** A subclass of `TriangularPySim` reproducing the dbbc300 frill source vector was run across n=15..161 with b/a=2.3 (NEC2's ~50 Ω default), and a separate b/a sensitivity sweep at fixed n=81:

    ```
        n  |   delta-gap         |   frill (b/a=2.3)
        15 |  43.208 + j37.161   |  43.212 + j37.168
        21 |  43.167 + j38.058   |  43.171 + j38.066
        81 |  43.123 + j38.828   |  43.127 + j38.835
       161 |  43.119 + j38.859   |  43.124 + j38.867

        b/a  |   frill Z at n=81
        1.5  |  43.125 + j38.832
        2.3  |  43.127 + j38.835
        5.0  |  43.140 + j38.849
       10.0  |  43.180 + j38.887
       30.0  |  43.487 + j39.172
    ```

    Frill − delta-gap = (+0.005, +0.008j) Ω at any sensible b/a. Even pushing b/a to 30 only shifts Z by ~0.5 Ω. **The feed-singularity hypothesis is rejected for the hentenna**, same null result as item 5 (V dipoles) and item 12 (fandipole K=3). Pysim's converged Z does *not* depend on whether the feed is modelled as δ-gap or a finite-extent coaxial frill, so calling pysim "the converged answer for a basis-bandlimited feed" was overstated — the source-vector projection isn't the lever. The non-convergence in PyNEC is therefore not a feed-singularity artifact either; the mechanism remains open and lies somewhere in the basis × kernel × junction interaction that the three probes (5, 12, 13) have so far ruled out as feed-related.

    pymininec at n=21 also read −j5.04 (matching PyNEC). Given the convergence picture, this is the same under-convergence at the same coarse n on two pulse-basis solvers — not an independent confirmation of "−j5 is correct." A per-n pymininec sweep would confirm it shows the same super-log climb.

    **nec2c sweep — independent NEC2 implementation, same trajectory.** Re-ran the same hentenna deck through Neoklis Kyriazis's [nec2c](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/noble/en/man1/nec2c.1.html) (a C translation of the LLNL Fortran, independent code lineage from Tim Molteno's necpp that PyNEC wraps):

    ```
        n   |  nec2c (R + jX)     |  PyNEC (R + jX)     |  Δ (R, X)
        15  |  45.614 − j5.838    |  45.613 − j5.769    |  +0.001, −0.069
        21  |  45.606 − j4.673    |  45.604 − j4.604    |  +0.002, −0.069
        81  |  45.245 + j1.578    |  45.244 + j1.646    |  +0.001, −0.068
       161  |  45.008 + j6.469    |  45.006 + j6.536    |  +0.002, −0.067
       281  |  44.735 +j12.648    |  44.733 +j12.722    |  +0.002, −0.074
       441  |  44.424 +j20.110    |  44.423 +j20.218    |  +0.001, −0.108
    ```

    Two findings: (a) R matches to ~0.002 Ω across the entire range, X to ~0.07 Ω — small enough to be linear-solver / complex-arithmetic precision (different LU paths), so **PyNEC has no implementation bug**; (b) nec2c's X climbs the same super-log curve (dX/d(log n) monotonically increasing from 3.5 to 18.1, same shape as PyNEC) — so **the divergence is the NEC2 algorithm, not any PyNEC artifact**. Two independent NEC2 implementations agree on both the value and the non-convergence.

    **Relation to item 8 (fandipole).** Inverted-looking but structurally consistent: there pysim/pymininec agreed on R against PyNEC's drift; here PyNEC drifts on X with no asymptote in sight. Both cases point to the same conclusion: **on multi-wire/junction geometries with a delta-gap feed, NEC's pulse-ish basis can fail to converge, while pysim's tent basis gives a finite (basis-defined) value**. The `tests/test_pysim.py` comment attributing the fan-dipole pysim/PyNEC gap to "basis-shape at K=3 junctions" should be re-checked against an explicit per-solver convergence sweep — it may be the same non-convergence story.

    **What's open**:
    - Add hentenna to the cross-solver comparison scripts (extend `scripts/compare_fandipole_solvers.py` or a new `compare_hentenna_solvers.py`) and have it plot `X vs log(n)` so the super-log signature is visible at a glance.
    - Per-n pymininec sweep on the hentenna to confirm it shows the same super-log climb (vs converging or hitting a different wall).
    - Re-run the fandipole at multiple n with all three solvers and re-do the `dX/d(log n)` analysis to test whether the K=3 "basis-shape" story is actually a non-convergence story too.
    - Decide what to do about the UI default for hentenna. n=21 is fine for pysim and badly wrong for PyNEC, and unlike a normal under-convergence there's no "high enough N" that fixes PyNEC — it just keeps drifting. Options: keep n=21 + UI warning that PyNEC on hentenna is non-convergent, raise the default and accept the cost, or refuse PyNEC for hentenna at the request layer (least surprising).
    - The mechanism behind PyNEC's super-log divergence remains open. Probes that have ruled out causes: feed model (item 5, item 13 frill probe — frill barely changes pysim's Z), K=3 junction kernel regularization (item 12), junction multiplicity (item 12, K=1/2/3 all show ~constant ΔX). Remaining candidates worth a probe: NEC2's source-on-segment-containing-junction handling; thin-wire kernel behaviour on segments adjacent to the source on a short feed wire; whether pysim's tent basis has its own basis-induced regularization at the junction that PyNEC lacks.
    - **What would arbitrate pysim vs PyNEC** (which was the bigger open question — pysim could still have been converged-to-the-wrong-place). NEC4 won't do it (same MoM family). Independent arbiters, ranked by cost:
      1. ~~**Higher-order B-spline in pysim**~~ (item 9) — **done in PR #45**. `BSplinePySim(degree=2)` at the hentenna params_50 sweep lands at 43.05 + j38.84 across n=15..81 (no drift, no super-log climb, monotonic 0.02 Ω tightening with n). Triangular (d=1) is at ~43.11 + j38.79 at n=81. **The two independent basis families agree to ~0.1 Ω** — and d=2 converges *faster* (already at j38.85 by n=15 where d=1 is still climbing). **This settles the arbitration: pysim's tent basis is correct; NEC's three-term basis is the outlier.** The reasoning is now closed at this question and was never about which solver was "physically correct" in some abstract sense — it's that two basis families that approach the EFIE from completely different polynomial-expansion directions both arrive at the same Z. The remaining hentenna mystery (what *mechanism* in the NEC three-term basis produces the super-log drift) is now item 14's "open at lower priority" — interesting but no longer load-bearing.
      2. **FDTD** (openEMS, Meep, or similar). Completely different formulation — no MoM basis, no delta-gap singularity. Genuinely independent. Now superseded as the *needed* arbiter by item-9 above; would still be a nice belt-and-suspenders check if FDTD lands at 43 + j38.8 too.
      3. **Surface-MoM with RWG basis** treating the wire as a thin cylinder. Different basis, different kernel singularity, same Maxwell. Same status as FDTD: belt-and-suspenders, no longer load-bearing.
      4. **Published measurement.** Hentennas are a 1970s amateur-radio antenna with measured VSWR/Z data possibly in the JA literature; a search and translation pass might find a ground-truth point for params_50. Confirmation rather than arbitration now.

14. **NEC's super-log X drift is intrinsic to the three-term basis — isolated by `SinusoidalPySim`.** Implemented NEC2's basis from the design document (`docs/nec2_theory_manual.pdf`, derivation in `docs/sinusoidal_basis_design.md`) in `src/pysim/sinusoidal.py` (PR #44). From-scratch — shares none of necpp's code; matches the manual's Eqs 43-64 for closed-form Wu-King coefficients, Eqs 76-79 for the per-segment field, Eq 187 for the delta-gap source. Scope: free space, thin-wire kernel, uniform radius, X_i=0 free-end. Hentenna params_50 sweep against PyNEC's numbers from item 13:

    ```
       n   | sin pysim R+jX    | PyNEC R+jX        |  ΔR     ΔX
       15  | 45.611 − j 5.718  | 45.613 − j 5.769  | −0.00  +0.05
       21  | 45.602 − j 4.553  | 45.604 − j 4.604  | −0.00  +0.05
       81  | 45.242 + j 1.693  | 45.244 + j 1.646  | −0.00  +0.05
      161  | 45.004 + j 6.540  | 45.006 + j 6.536  | −0.00  +0.00
      201  | 44.908 + j 8.736  | 44.910 + j 8.670  | −0.00  +0.07
      281  | 44.739 + j13.064  | 44.733 + j12.722  | +0.01  +0.34
      441  | 44.381 + j16.796  | 44.423 + j20.218  | −0.04  −3.42
    ```

    R matches PyNEC to ~0.05 Ω across the entire range. X matches to ~0.05 Ω through n=281, then opens up a 3.4 Ω gap at n=441 (likely a quadrature accuracy issue in my `n_qp_const=8` for the const-current self integral once segments shrink below a critical length — worth a follow-up but doesn't affect the qualitative finding).

    **Settles**: the *NEC side* of "what's open" in item 13. The probes there ruled out feed model, K=3 junction kernel regularization, junction multiplicity, and the second NEC2 implementation (nec2c) as causes. With a from-scratch sinusoidal-basis solver in a completely independent codebase reproducing the drift, the cause is the **three-term basis itself** — neither NEC's kernel implementation, nor its source vector, nor its junction-handling code, nor anything else specific to necpp.

    **Does not settle**: which solver is physically correct. Both the triangular basis (converging to ~43 + j39) and the three-term basis (drifting super-logarithmically) are now characterized; the choice between them is the same arbitration question as before. The remaining arbiters in item 13's list still apply, with the focus narrowed: the question is no longer "what in NEC is causing this" but "which basis converges to the right value."

    **What's next from here**:
    - ~~Higher-order B-spline in pysim (item 9)~~ — **done in PR #45**. `BSplinePySim(degree=2)` at the hentenna params_50 sweep lands at 43.05 + j38.84 across n=15..81 (essentially constant). Triangular at n=81 is 43.11 + j38.79. The two basis families agree to ~0.1 Ω. **Tent is validated; the three-term basis is the outlier**. See item 9 / item 13's "What would arbitrate" list / the PR #45 entry above for the full result.
    - Investigate the n=441 X gap in `SinusoidalPySim` (the only remaining hentenna-related accuracy issue). Likely candidates: (a) quadrature node count for `_field_tensor`'s `int_G0` (currently `n_qp_const=8`; try 16, 32), (b) a sign/normalization edge case in the basis-coefficient closed forms that only matters at very small Δ, (c) PyNEC's own quadrature differing slightly from mine at that resolution — bumping `n_qp_const` and seeing whether my values move toward or away from PyNEC's is the first probe. *Now lower priority since the arbitration is settled — this is just sinusoidal-quadrature accuracy, no longer a load-bearing question.*
    - Add `SinusoidalPySim` and `BSplinePySim` to the cross-solver comparison scripts and the web UI as additional solver tabs. The UI integration would make the basis-induced X drift visible on the Smith chart in real time (sinusoidal drift on hentenna alongside tent and B-spline staying converged).
    - The hentenna `n_feed` parity rule: pysim's triangular basis wants EVEN n_feed (tent-basis interior knot at z=0); pysim's sinusoidal basis wants ODD n_feed (delta-gap segment centred at z=0); pysim's B-spline d=2 wants EVEN n_feed (same as triangular — there's an interior knot at z=0 in both cases). Same as PyNEC's parity for the sinusoidal case — confirmed by item 14's near-zero ΔR. Document this in `web/server.py`'s `_hentenna_geometry` so the multi-way solver toggle picks the right parity per backend.
    - **What's now genuinely open** about the three-term basis super-log drift (lower priority — the arbitration is settled, this is just academic interest): the *mechanism*. The probes have ruled out feed model (items 5, 13, 14), K=3 junction kernel regularization (item 12), junction multiplicity (item 12), and the second NEC2 implementation (nec2c) as causes. The drift is intrinsic to the three-term basis on multi-wire/junction geometries. *Why* — what specifically about the const + sin + cos expansion fails on a K=3 junction-rich, non-resonant geometry — is interesting but not load-bearing for any downstream decision. Theoretical conjecture in conversation logs: as h shrinks, sin(k·h) ≈ k·h and cos(k·h) ≈ 1 - (k·h)²/2 so the basis approaches polynomial form *but* with a k-dependent phase reference s_n that creates near-linear-dependence between adjacent segments at small h.

### B-spline enrichment re-evaluation post-PR-#51 — closed

15. ~~**Re-evaluate the B-spline enrichment basis with PR #51's `orig=1` sign fix.**~~ — **closed across (a)/(b)/(c)/(d) on the `bspline-enrichment-reeval` branch**. Three new probe scripts:
    - `scripts/compare_hentenna_solvers.py` — 4-solver hentenna sweep (Triangular / BSpline d=2 no-enrich / BSpline d=2 enrich / PyNEC) across n ∈ {15, 21, 41, 81, 161}. Item 13's open task ("add hentenna to the cross-solver comparison scripts") shipped here too.
    - `scripts/probe_y_fixture_enrichment.py` — K=3 Y fixture at λ/4 arms, d=1 vs d=2 with/without enrichment, n ∈ {15, 21, 41, 81, 161, 241}.
    - `scripts/probe_bent_dipole_enrichment.py` — 90° bent dipole in both polyline-kink and K=2-junction representations, d=1 and d=2, with/without enrichment_min_k ∈ {2, 3}.

    **(a) Hentenna arbitration value reconfirmed at 43.05 + j38.84.** Post-PR-#51 sweep across all four pysim bases + PyNEC (nfeed=2 for the polynomial bases tri/b2/b2e; nfeed=3 for the three-term bases sin/pynec, matching their source-segment-centering rule):

    ```
       n  |   tri         |   b2 (no enr) |   b2e (enr)   |   sin           |   pynec
       15 | 43.20 + j37.13 | 43.07 + j38.85 | 42.86 + j40.07 | 45.61 − j 5.72 | 45.61 − j 5.77
       21 | 43.16 + j38.03 | 43.07 + j38.85 | 43.03 + j39.09 | 45.60 − j 4.55 | 45.60 − j 4.60
       41 | 43.13 + j38.65 | 43.06 + j38.84 | 43.06 + j38.86 | 45.46 − j 1.78 | 45.44 − j 1.84
       81 | 43.11 + j38.79 | 43.05 + j38.84 | 43.05 + j38.84 | 45.25 + j 1.71 | 45.24 + j 1.65
      161 | 43.11 + j38.82 | 43.05 + j38.84 | 43.05 + j38.84 | 44.98 + j 6.51 | 45.01 + j 6.54
    ```

    The **polynomial trio** (tri / b2 / b2e) converges to the same Z asymptote ≈ 43.05 + j38.84 — the PR #45 / item-9 arbitration value unchanged. The **three-term pair** (sin / pynec) drifts super-log on X; `SinusoidalPySim` tracks `PyNEC` to ~0.05 Ω on R and ~0.07 Ω on X at every n, as predicted by item 14. Two independent basis families, each with multiple independent code paths, with the polynomial side reaching an asymptote that the three-term side cannot — the arbitration is now visible in a single table.

    X-rates over the (41, 81, 161) triple: tri p ≈ 2.19 (basis-limited at degree-1's O(1/N²)), b2 p ≈ 2.53 (tail-noise; already at convergence by n=15), b2e p ≈ 3.23. Three-term pair: sin p ≈ −0.46, pynec p ≈ −0.50 — both anti-convergent, tracking together.

    **The conjecture in the open question was wrong**: the buggy sign wasn't masking a real enrichment speed-up. With the fix, b2e is still *slower at low n* than b2 (b2e at n=15 is 1.2 Ω off the asymptote; b2 is already there to ~0.02 Ω). The enrichment basis adds a higher-order tail but pays its own low-N transient. **Decision**: the slot-B UI default should flip from `use_singular_enrichment=True` to `False` for the hentenna preset — b2 alone at n=21 gives 43.07 + j38.85 (within 0.02 Ω of asymptote) while b2e at n=21 gives 43.03 + j39.09 (0.26 Ω off X). The PR #45 `test_bspline_d2_hentenna_arbitrates_against_triangular` tolerance was tightened from 1.0 Ω to 0.2 Ω on the cross-basis disagreement check now that we know b2 is already at convergence at n=21.

    **(b) d=1 enrichment is a no-op** (Y-fixture, λ/4 arms, K=3 at S):

    ```
       n   |    d=1         |    d=1 enr      |    d=2          |    d=2 enr
       15  | 50.22 + j51.82 | 50.24 + j51.85  | 50.29 + j52.56  | 50.38 + j52.56
       21  | 50.29 + j52.22 | 50.30 + j52.23  | 50.30 + j52.71  | 50.38 + j52.72
       41  | 50.36 + j52.65 | 50.37 + j52.65  | 50.32 + j52.92  | 50.39 + j52.92
       81  | 50.40 + j52.87 | 50.40 + j52.87  | 50.33 + j53.04  | 50.40 + j53.04
      161  | 50.41 + j52.99 | 50.42 + j52.99  | 50.34 + j53.11  | 50.42 + j53.11
      241  | 50.42 + j53.04 | 50.43 + j53.05  | 50.34 + j53.14  | 50.42 + j53.15
    ```

    d=1 ↔ d=1-enrich agreement is ~0.01 Ω at every n with identical fitted rates (p ≈ 1.0 on X for both). Interpretation: the tent basis already has a slope discontinuity at every interior knot — it represents the K=3-junction current cusp "for free", so adding the log-singular shape changes essentially nothing. **No port of enrichment to `TriangularPySim` is warranted.** This is a useful negative result.

    Bonus finding from the Y-fixture (not visible on the hentenna): at d=2, enrichment shifts R by ~0.08 Ω in a way that persists to n=241 (does not shrink). d=2 alone converges to a different asymptote than d=1 alone (~50.34 vs ~50.42); d=2 + enrichment matches d=1 alone. The C¹ d=2 basis can't represent the junction-cusp on its own; enrichment supplies it. Why this doesn't show on the hentenna: there the K=3 junctions sit in a near-resonant standing-wave configuration where current through the junction is small, so the cusp contribution is proportionally tiny. The Y has a feed driving directly into a K=3 junction with no resonance damping; the cusp is loud.

    **(c) enrichment_min_k=2 actively HARMS** (bent-dipole, 90° per arm; full-wave anti-resonance so |Z| is large):

    ```
       k2 d=2  no enrich vs  k2 d=2 enrichment_min_k=2  (ΔR, ΔX in Ω)
       n=15 :  ΔR = −597.18   ΔX = +111.82
       n=21 :  ΔR = −516.82   ΔX = + 93.13
       n=41 :  ΔR = −475.59   ΔX = + 82.96
       n=81 :  ΔR = −469.36   ΔX = + 81.42
    ```

    The two solutions are not converging to the same place. The log-singular shape Φ_sing(u) ~ u·log(u) is *wrong* for K=2 bends: a K=2 bend has KCL `I_in = −I_out` (continuity through the bend, no current splitting), so the local charge density isn't log-singular. Forcing the wrong-shaped basis into the system pulls Z to an incorrect limit. The doc's working hypothesis was "shouldn't help"; the data is stronger — **do not use enrichment_min_k=2**. The default `enrichment_min_k=3` is correct.

    K=1 free-end sub-question: moot in current code. `BSplinePySim`'s constructor rejects single-wire-end "junctions" (`len(jw) < 2: raise ValueError`). PR #48 smoothed source remains the principled fix for the source-singularity rate.

    **(d) polyline-kink ↔ K=2-junction representations are bit-exact equivalent for both d=1 and d=2** under BSpline:

    ```
       pl vs k2 disagreement on the bent dipole (n=15..81):
       d=1:  |ΔR| ≤ 5e-12 Ω, |ΔX| ≤ 5e-12 Ω
       d=2:  |ΔR| ≤ 1e-4 Ω,  |ΔX| ≤ 1e-4 Ω   (still roundoff-class)
    ```

    My hypothesis that the C¹ d=2 polyline basis would "smear" the kink was wrong — BSpline rebuilds the basis with a slope break at every polyline anchor too. **Item 16's open question ("does it actually change any answer?") is settled with a clean NO**, for both bases. The architectural unification reduces to a pure code-clarity question. See item 16 for the updated trade-off.

16. **Architectural question: model bends as K=2 junctions instead of as polyline kinks?** Item 15(d) settled the correctness question — the two representations are bit-exact equivalent for `TriangularPySim` (existing test `test_triangular_k2_junction_equivalent_to_single_polyline`) and for `BSplinePySim` at both d=1 and d=2 (probe_bent_dipole_enrichment.py). So this is purely a code-clarity question now.

    Trade-offs (no correctness component left):

    - **Pro:** the polyline-kink path and the junction path are doing approximately the same thing (enforcing current continuity at a node where the tangent changes). One uniform mechanism is conceptually nicer than two slightly different ones.
    - **Con:** every polyline-style geometry input (every UI antenna currently) would need to either be auto-decomposed at the server level or rewritten to use junctions. Mass refactor.
    - **Con:** the Lagrange-multiplier KCL row adds N_bends rows to the solve matrix. For an inverted V with one bend, that's +1 row. For a moxon with 8 bends, +8 rows. Tiny on N≈400-segment fan dipoles but not free.
    - **Con:** within-wire basis continuity is currently *automatic* (the tent basis spans the kink); junction directional bases are by construction one-wing — losing the natural continuity means the basis at a bend would be K=2 directional rather than a single interior tent.
    - **The earlier "pro" about enrichment scaffolding (item 15(d)) is gone**: 15(c) showed enrichment at K=2 bends is actively harmful, so making bends into K=2 junctions doesn't unlock any enrichment story.

    Recommendation: don't do this refactor. The polyline-kink path is correct, equally accurate as the K=2-junction path, simpler for users, and doesn't pay the Lagrange-row cost. Architectural symmetry is a weak motivator against the implementation cost.

### Visualization fidelity follow-ups

17. **Visualization fidelity gaps from `docs/visualization_audit.md`.** Audit done after PR #51 caught the orig=1 sign bug; doc catalogues remaining mismatches between what the solvers compute and what the canvas renders. Severity grades and recommended fixes are in the doc. Headline:

    - **G1 + A1 + A2 combined fix**: extend `currents_at_knots` to take an optional `s_array` per wire (or fixed segment-quarter-points) so the heatmap stroke and the far-field path can sample at mid-segment points where B-spline d=2 quadratic curvature and the enrichment dip actually live. Single coherent change spanning model + server + frontend. Highest value of the remaining items.
    - **G3**: draw a thin ground-line at `z=0` when `result.ground === true`. ~10 LOC of canvas code, removes a "where is the ground" guessing game from the UI.
    - **G4**: visual sanity check that PyNEC vs Triangular ground at the same height produces meaningfully different far-field lobes (different Fresnel reflection coefficients). No code change expected, just verification.
    - **G2** (Lagrange multipliers exposed via solve API): probably no action, debugging-grade info.

    None of these are urgent. Item 15 is higher-value because it re-tests the arbitration value that several other items hinge on; visualization fidelity is a separable lane.

### Interactive UI follow-ups

10. **UI follow-ups** — Yagi (with N directors), moxon, hexbeam, and fan dipole all ship in the interactive UI. Open work:
    - **Solver overlay on Smith plot**: currently the pysim/pynec tab toggle replaces the displayed solve; an overlay drawing *both* points/sweeps on the Smith chart simultaneously would make solver-disagreement geometries (fan dipole, see PR #36) visually obvious without manual A/B.
    - **Fan dipole 3D rotation**: the side-view (yz plane) collapses x-axis cone variation. The 5-band default has visible x-spread that the projection drops. A simple azimuth-rotation control or isometric view would surface it.
    - **Solver agreement diagnostic**: when pysim and pynec disagree by more than some threshold (say 5% of |Z|), surface a small indicator in the UI noting "solvers differ by X Ω — see geometry-specific known-issue".

11. ~~**Far-field pattern enhancements**~~ — **all three sub-items shipped**. `FarFieldChart` in `web/frontend/src/App.tsx` renders both an azimuth (xy) cone-cut and an elevation (yz) great-circle-cut tab; the radial axis is absolute dBi with a fixed 30-dB display range (DBI_TOP=10, ticks at +6/0/−6/−12/−18); per-direction directivity uses the server-supplied `result.directivity_norm` (sphere-integrated `|E|²` total radiated power) so the gain reading is absolute, not per-frame normalized. View-switcher tabs at the top of the stage select among antenna / azimuth / elevation / smith. PR not separately tagged — the pieces landed across the multi-backend UI work in PR #49 and the ground-plane far-field work in PR #50.

### Open research

9. ~~**Higher-order basis functions**~~ — **done in PR #45** (`BSplinePySim(degree=2)`). Quadratic B-spline Galerkin MoM with the same multi-wire / polyline / K-wire-junction machinery as `TriangularPySim`. The closed-form same-edge static-kernel moment integrals J_pq for p, q ∈ {0..2} are sympy-derived once and dumped to `src/pysim/_bspline_static_moments.py` (no runtime sympy dep; `scripts/derive_bspline_static_moments.py` re-runs the derivation with larger `MAX_D`). Convergence-rate observation matches O(1/N³): on the dipole d=2 reaches the NEC reference at N=15 (j-18.4 vs NEC's j-18.21) where d=1 is still at j-21.3. On the hentenna it converges to 43.05 + j38.84 ± 0.01 Ω at *every* n in {15, 21, 41, 81}. The arbitration use this enabled is the load-bearing result — see item 14 and the PR #45 entry above.

  d > 2 not implemented yet — the static-moment expressions grow combinatorially (8 KB code for d=2; estimated ~30 KB for d=3). Likely unnecessary unless we want to probe a *third* basis family for an even stronger arbitration claim.

12. ~~**Cross-wire kernel regularization for close-fanning junctions**~~ — **investigated and ruled out on the `per-pair-kernel-reg` branch**; the regularization is not the cause of the fan-dipole pysim/PyNEC gap. Two probes:

    **Probe 1 (sensitivity)**: hacked the cross-wire block of `_build_J_blocks` to use an `a_xw = factor · a` regularization for cross-wire pairs only, leaving same-wire-different-edge (kink) pairs at `a²`. Swept `factor` over 4 orders of magnitude on the 2-band fan dipole (K=3 junctions at S and T):

    ```
      factor    a_xw (mm)      R         X      |Z-PyNEC|
      1.0000     0.50000     63.40     15.27       22.68
      0.0010     0.00050     63.40     15.27       22.68
    ```

    Per-pair J-matrix entries change by ~0.5% (verified at the junction-adjacent pair), but **the impedance changes by < 0.001 Ω**. The cross-wire regularization is irrelevant to Z for this geometry.

    **Probe 2 (junction multiplicity)**: ran the K=2 case (single 20m band, only K=2 junctions at S and T, no close-fanning K≥3 geometry):

    ```
                       R         X
       K=1 single   pysim: 63.4 + j16.3,  PyNEC: 66.1 + j 1.0  →  ΔX = +15.3
       K=2 double   pysim: 63.4 + j15.3,  PyNEC: 46.3 + j 0.4  →  ΔX = +14.9
       K=3 triple   pysim: 63.5 + j14.5,  PyNEC: 41.5 - j 0.1  →  ΔX = +14.6
    ```

    The ~15 Ω ΔX is **constant across K**. K=1 has no K≥3 junction at all and still shows the same gap. The disagreement is not about junction multiplicity.

    Combined with item 8's pysim-vs-pymininec agreement on R, the conclusion: all three sub-options (per-pair regularization, adaptive junction meshing, sinusoidal-segment basis at junction nodes) were targeting K≥3 junction effects that don't exist as the dominant cause. The dominant effect is NEC2's formulation choices, not anything in pysim's local junction treatment. **Item closed.**

    **Postscript (`fandipole-even-ring` branch, item 8 update)**: after fixing the lopsided pentagon `_FANDIPOLE_RING_5` to evenly distribute K bands at 360°/K, the ~15 Ω X-part of what was being called "the fan-dipole disagreement" turned out to be a *geometry* artifact (lopsided ring) that had been incorrectly attributed to junction/formulation effects. The original PR #36 cone-angle sweep (~7 Ω tracking inter-arm angle) was also partly contaminated by the same ring asymmetry — when n_bands varied while still using the pentagon prefix, the inter-arm angle changes mixed with ring-position bias. The remaining real-part disagreement (~5–17 Ω growing with K and N) is what's left after that contamination is removed; it sits in the same family as item 8's "NEC2 outlier" conclusion. No new actions — item stays closed.

18. ~~**Stable / XFEM-style enrichment basis to make `use_singular_enrichment=True` safe at small N on dominant-pair K=3 junctions.**~~ — **implemented as opt-in (`enrichment_variant="stable"`) on the `stable-xfem-enrichment` branch; doesn't deliver the predicted universal safety, so default remains `"raw"`.** Background as previously stated: hentenna-class K=3 geometries (dominant in/out pair + small tap, per `scripts/probe_k3_junction_imbalance.py`) get a ~0.26 Ω X offset at small N from the 6 enrichment DOFs absorbing polynomial-basis discretization error rather than representing real cusp physics.

    **Implementation.** `BSplinePySim` grew an `enrichment_variant` kwarg (`"raw"` | `"stable"`, default `"raw"`):

    ```
    Φ_sing_stable(t) = t·log(t) − P_bubble(t·log(t))
    ```

    where `P_bubble` is the L²-orthogonal projection onto the polynomial **bubble subspace** of P_d on [0,1] — the polynomials that vanish at both t=0 and t=1. For d=2 that's `span{t(1−t)}` (1D); for d=1 it's `{0}` (empty), so the "stable" variant reduces to "raw" bit-exact at d=1 — consistent with item 15(b)'s "d=1 enrichment is a no-op" finding. The projection coefficients are pure constants per degree (h-independent, geometry-independent); the C++ kernel takes them as an extra `proj_coeffs` argument and subtracts inline at every quadrature point.

    **Why project against the bubble subspace, not full P_d.** The full-P_d projection breaks Φ_sing's u=0 boundary condition (Φ_sing_stable(0) = +0.125 for d=2 instead of 0), which violates the finite-current condition at the K-wire junction — the KCL constraint only sees polynomial bases, so an enrichment that doesn't self-zero at the junction node carries uncompensated current there. Measured: full-P_d projection gives ~42.98 R at n=81 on hentenna (drift of 0.1 Ω from the asymptote). Projecting against the BC-preserving bubble subspace preserves both Φ_sing(0)=Φ_sing(1)=0 and the cusp shape at t=0+.

    **Measured outcomes (vs the predicted ones):**

    | geometry | n | b2 (no enr) | b2e raw | b2e stable | predicted | actual |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
    | hentenna | 21 | j38.87 | j39.13 | j39.66 | small-N transient vanishes | **transient WORSE** (+0.79 vs raw's +0.26) |
    | hentenna | 81 | j38.87 | j38.87 | j38.88 | matches at every N | matches at large N ✓ |
    | Y-fixture | 161 | 50.339 | 50.42 (d=1 value) | 50.341 | still wins ~0.08 Ω R correction | **cusp benefit LOST** |
    | fan dipole | 81 | j−4.435 | j−4.435 | j−4.437 | gap shrinks to noise floor | noise floor ✓ |
    | bent-dipole k2 enr=2 | 81 | (no-enr) | ΔR=−469 Ω (PR #51 era) | ΔR=−30 Ω | (alternative not predicted) | misuse-harm reduced 15× ✓ |

    Stable X-rate on hentenna in the (41,81,161) window is p ≈ 4.10 (vs raw's ~2.7 vs no-enr b2's 2.53) — so it does converge faster *once past the small-N transient*.

    **Root cause of mixed result.** The bubble subspace `span{t(1−t)}` is only 1-dimensional for d=2, so the orthogonalization is partial — Φ_sing_stable can still couple to the 2D of P_d that has non-zero endpoint values. Meanwhile, the BC constraint shrinks Φ_sing_stable's peak magnitude from ~0.37 to ~0.018, so the same physical cusp requires a much larger enrichment coefficient α (amplifying numerical sensitivity) and the stable variant can't absorb the polynomial-bubble mass that the raw variant was using to capture the Y-fixture cusp.

    The literature's "stable GFEM" projects against the full polynomial space — which works in problems where the singular function doesn't have endpoint BCs to preserve. Adapting it cleanly to this K-wire-junction setting where Φ_sing has both vanishing endpoint values + a log-divergent slope at one end appears to be open research, not a 1-day port.

    **Disposition.** "raw" stays default in `BSplinePySim`, `web/server.py`'s allowlist, and the slot-B UI default (`useSingularEnrichment=false`). The "stable" variant is exposed as an opt-in via the slot's gear menu for users who want faster large-N convergence and don't care about the n≤21 transient. Tests: `test_bspline_d2_hentenna_enrichment_stable_variant` pins the stable n=81 hentenna value and the d=1-equivalence-to-raw property.

    Alternatives still on the table (notes for future-us):
    - **Tikhonov regularization** (add λ·I to the enrichment-block diagonal): **also implemented on this branch as `enrichment_variant="tikhonov"` with `tikhonov_lambda` knob.** Scaling is dimensionless: `Z_ee += λ·s·I` where `s = mean(|diag(Z_ee)|)`. Limits verified by `test_bspline_d2_hentenna_enrichment_tikhonov_variant`: λ=0 bit-exact to raw; λ→∞ bit-exact (~1e-7 rel) to no-enr. Sweep across (λ, geometry, n):

      ```
                       hentenna n=21 (target j38.873 ≡ no-enr)   Y-fix n=81 R (target 50.40 ≡ cusp captured)
         raw         : 43.062 + j39.119  (+0.25 X transient)     50.404                            (cusp ✓)
         stable      : 43.019 + j39.658  (+0.79 X — worse)       50.341                            (cusp ✗)
         tik λ=0.001 : 43.06  + j39.12   (≈ raw)                 50.40                             (≈ raw)
         tik λ=0.03  : 43.11  + j39.12   (X unchanged, R nudged) 50.40                             (≈ raw)
         tik λ=0.1   : 43.19  + j39.06   (X half-fixed)          50.40                             (cusp ✓)
         tik λ=0.3   : 43.19  + j38.94   (X ¾-fixed)             50.37                             (cusp slipping)
         tik λ=1.0   : 43.13  + j38.89   (X fully fixed)         50.34                             (cusp ✗)
         tik λ=3.0   : 43.11  + j38.88   (≈ no-enr)              50.33                             (cusp ✗)
      ```

      No universal λ exists — the same Z_ee diagonal that absorbs hentenna's spurious polynomial-discretization error also carries Y-fixture's legitimate cusp coefficient, and Tikhonov shrinks both proportionally. **Sweet-spot λ ≈ 0.1** as a compromise default (Y cusp preserved within 0.005 Ω; modest hentenna improvement) — but doesn't fully suppress the hentenna transient. `λ=1.0` matches no-enr on hentenna but kills the Y cusp. Frontend default is 0.1; users can dial it per slot.
    - **Posteriori threshold** (solve → zero small |α_enrich,k| → resolve): also tunable.
    - **Two-pass tap_ratio auto-toggle** — **also implemented on this branch as `enrichment_variant="auto"` with `auto_tap_ratio_threshold` knob (default 0.3).** Solves once without enrichment, measures `tap_ratio = min(|I_wire|)/max(|I_wire|)` at each K≥`enrichment_min_k` junction using the polynomial-only knot currents (the bspline directional basis is the only one nonzero at a junction node, so reading off `currents_at_knots` at the junction-side knot gives the per-wire current directly), then re-solves with raw enrichment restricted to junctions above threshold. Verified by `test_bspline_enrichment_auto_two_pass_selects_correctly`: hentenna at n=21 produces `active=[]` and matches no-enr **bit-exact** (the +0.25 Ω X transient that raw introduces is gone); Y-fixture at n=41 produces `active=[1]` (the K=3 at S; the K=2 at T correctly excluded by enrichment_min_k=3) and matches raw **bit-exact** (cusp preserved). **This is the per-junction selectivity story** stable/tikhonov can't deliver — the spurious-vs-legitimate distinction is geometric (which junctions are dominant-pair vs balanced 3-way), and auto reads that geometry directly from the pass-1 current solution rather than trying to encode it into the basis or the solve.
    - **Blending / partition-of-unity XFEM**: multiply Φ_sing by a partition-of-unity that decays smoothly from the junction; literature suggests this captures the right physics with better conditioning. More implementation effort.

    None of these are urgent — "raw" with the slot-B `useSingularEnrichment=false` default already ships a working answer for all current UI presets. **Recommendation for users running custom geometries with enrichment on: switch to `enrichment_variant="auto"`** — it's the only variant that's geometry-aware. One extra solve pass; skipped entirely if no junction qualifies.

### BSpline ↔ Triangular feature parity (may-never-do)

These are gaps `BSplinePySim(degree=1, ...)` has relative to `TriangularPySim`, even though d=1 is mathematically the same tent basis. None are blocking — the bspline solver works correctly on every geometry the triangular solver handles. They're listed so we know what'd be involved if performance ever turned out to matter on the bspline path, and so the asymmetry doesn't get forgotten.

19. **Batched swept assembly path for `BSplinePySim`.** Triangular's `compute_impedance_swept(k_array)` builds the full `(n_k, M, M)` Z stack in one shot via batched C++ kernels and a batched Schur-complement KCL solve (PR #11, #12, #13, #37). BSpline's swept literally says "Loop over wavenumbers (no batched assembly here yet)" in `compute_impedance_swept` (`src/pysim/bspline.py:1284`) — it just rebinds `self.k`/`self.omega` per k and re-runs single-frequency `compute_impedance()`. So an n_k=41 sweep pays the J-build + Z-assembly + factorization setup 41× instead of once.

    Estimated speedup gap on the bspline d=1 path vs triangular's swept path: 2–3× on geometries without junctions (where the per-k overhead is mostly arithmetic) and 3–5× on K=3-junction geometries like fan dipole (where assembly + Schur + dispatch glue compound). Not measured precisely — no one's complained.

    **Memory caveat — the gap is not all upside.** Triangular's batched path holds 4 J tensors of shape `(n_k, N, N)` complex128 plus the assembly intermediates `S` and `I_A` of the same shape — peak around 7× n_k × N² × 16 bytes during assembly. At UI scale (n_k=41, N=80) that's ~30 MB; at fan-dipole sweep scale (n_k=41, N=400) it climbs to ~800 MB. The UI's `/sweep` endpoint already manages this by **adaptively chunking** the sweep into ~8-freq batches that retune to `_CHUNK_TARGET_MS` per chunk (`web/server.py:1595–1648`); per-chunk peak is ~5× less. BSpline's loop-per-k swept path is effectively `n_k=1` chunking — same memory profile as the UI chunker would target at very small chunks. So porting triangular's batched assembly to bspline doesn't strictly dominate; it's a memory-vs-time trade-off where the UI's existing chunker already covers the interactive use case.

    Sub-items, ranked roughly by leverage (mirrors item 6's ordering):

    - **19a. Batched J-build with k-axis.** Triangular has `_build_J_blocks_batch` calling `seg_seg_quad_batch_3d` and `seg_seg_reg_quad_batch_1d` with a `k_array` argument; each kernel produces `(n_k, N, N)` output and reuses the `R[q, r]` quadrature-point distance table across all k (PR #11 / #12). BSpline's `_seg_seg_full_moments_offedge` and friends are single-k. Largest single chunk of work in the port — the C++ kernels' template structure would need a `n_k` dimension added in the same way triangular's kernels do.

    - **19b. Batched `assemble_Z_bspline` with k-axis.** Mirror of triangular's PR #13 `assemble_Z` — a leading k-axis on the J tensors and the matching `parallel for collapse(2)` over `(k, m)`. BSpline's `assemble_Z_bspline` is single-k; bumping to batched is mostly a templated loop change. Same parity test pattern as the existing `test_bspline_cpp_assemble_z_matches_numpy` would apply (toggle `_HAVE_BSPLINE_ASSEMBLE_ACCEL`, compare against a swept-numpy reference).

    - **19c. `assemble_Z_bspline_general` accelerator + J-build fusion for junction geometries.** Mirror of triangular's PR #37 6g + 6h. Junction geometries currently go through the same single-k C++ path (`assemble_Z_bspline` handles the general case via `supp_seg_poly` / `polys_poly`), but a batched-with-k-axis version doesn't exist. Bigger payoff per LOC than 19b because fan-dipole-class junction geometries are exactly where the swept loop is slowest.

    - **19d. Batched Schur-complement KCL solve.** Mirror of triangular's PR #37 6i. BSpline already has Schur in single-k (`_solve_with_kcl`, `src/pysim/bspline.py:834`) — the augmented `[Z A^T; A 0]` system is reduced to a Z-solve plus a small `(n_c × n_c)` correction. Triangular extends the same trick to the batch by solving `Z [w | X] = [v | A^T]` with `(1 + n_c)` RHS columns simultaneously. The math ports directly; what's needed is a batched `scipy.linalg.solve` call and the surrounding glue.

    - **19e. Enrichment kernel with k-axis.** `assemble_Z_enrich` is single-k. A swept version would let the entire `compute_impedance_swept` path stay on the batched accelerators when enrichment is on. Lowest priority of the five — enrichment is rarely combined with sweeps in practice, and the auto variant's pass-1-needs-no-kernel optimization already mitigates worst case.

    Even if 19a–19d landed, BSpline d=2 would still pay an inherent cost that d=1 doesn't: the closed-form static-moment tables (`_bspline_static_moments.py`) get re-evaluated symbolically with each h, which is single-k by design. Refactoring that to be k-vectorized is its own subproject — file under 19f if anyone ever asks.

    **What bspline has that triangular doesn't** (the asymmetry runs both ways, so this section is honest about it):
    - Higher-order d=2 basis (the closed-form static-moment derivation in `scripts/derive_bspline_static_moments.py`)
    - Singular-basis enrichment with four variants (raw / stable / tikhonov / auto, PR #45 / #47 / #65 / current branch)
    - Smoothed delta-gap source (`feed_smoothing_factor`, PR #48) — triangular only has the sharp delta-gap; its magnetic-frill experiment was reverted (item 5)

    So porting triangular's batched machinery to bspline isn't strictly "make bspline faster"; it's "stop having two independent assembly pipelines for the same basis at d=1." The maintenance burden of carrying both is probably worse than the perf delta — which is why this section is the may-never-do part of the doc.

## Key locations

- `src/pysim/triangular.py` — the active solver. `_build_geometry` builds the per-basis support arrays (segments, level-at-left, level-at-right); `_add_junction_bases` (PR #36) appends K directional bases per junction and the KCL constraint matrix `kcl_A`; `_assemble_Z_single` is the fast path used for non-junction geometries (calls the C++ `assemble_Z` accelerator), `_assemble_Z_general_single` is the general path used when junctions exist. The Lagrange-augmented solve lives in `_solve_with_kcl` (single) and `_solve_with_kcl_batch` (swept).
- `web/server.py` — geometry-specific builders (`_solve_inverted_v`, `_solve_yagi`, `_solve_moxon`, `_solve_hexbeam`, `_solve_fandipole`) and their `_sweep_*` counterparts. `_fandipole_geometry` shows the K-band cone with junctions and the feed-wire-as-2-segments trick that puts the delta-gap source on an interior knot.
- `web/pynec_backend.py` — drop-in PyNEC backend mirroring the server's response shape. Useful as a comparator (the UI's solver-tab toggle picks between them).
- `scripts/compare_yagi_nec.py` — the NEC validation harness (single dipole and 2-element Yagi in free space). Requires PyNEC (build via `scripts/build_pynec.sh` after `git submodule update --init --recursive`):
  ```
  .venv/bin/python scripts/compare_yagi_nec.py
  ```
- `scripts/bspline_probe.py` — demonstrates scipy `BSpline` operations (design matrix, derivative, mass matrix vs analytic tent formulas). Reference for any future basis-function work.
- `docs/convergence_analysis.md` — full writeup of the pulse-basis convergence failure that motivated the triangular work. Reference for "why are we doing this."

## Conventions to know

- Always work in a branch; the repo uses rebase-merge so each branch commit lands on `main` verbatim
- CI runs `pytest tests/ -m 'not slow and not plot'` — anything marked `@pytest.mark.slow` or `@pytest.mark.plot` is dev-only
- Default global instructions are in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`; project-specific conventions (none currently) would go in `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root
