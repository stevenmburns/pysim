"""Feedline-network utilities used by multi-band antennas in daisy-chain
drive mode.

The single function `daisy_chain_z_in` takes the antenna's open-circuit
N-port Z matrix and stitches it together with N-1 50Ω transmission-line
jumpers, returning the single driving-point impedance the rig sees at
the main-feed end. Port 0 is the main-feed connection; ports 1..N-1
are subsequent stops along the chain; port N-1 is the open end.

Usage from momwire: build Y_sc via `TriangularSolver.compute_y_matrix`,
invert to get Z_oc, pass to `daisy_chain_z_in`. PyNEC's TL card path
solves the same problem natively (no Python-side math) — this helper
is just for the momwire half.
