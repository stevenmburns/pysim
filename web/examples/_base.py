"""Base types for the antenna-example registry.

An `AntennaExample` bundles everything the web layer needs to serve one
geometry: parameter schema, pysim solve/sweep, and pynec build/solve. Any
callable left as None signals the backend doesn't support that operation
for this geometry.

Keeping these as plain callables (rather than a class hierarchy) means
each example module is a flat file of functions plus one EXAMPLE = ...
assignment at the bottom — easy to read, easy to delete.

class ParamSpec:
    """One UI-exposed parameter for a geometry.

    Served from `GET /examples` so the frontend can render parameter
    controls generically — one ParamForm component reads the schema and
    builds the matching <input> elements without per-antenna JSX.

    `visible_when` makes a parameter conditional on another's value:
    e.g. yagi's director_spacing_wavelengths slider only appears when
    n_directors > 0. The dict is shaped {name, op, value}; ops include
    "eq", "ne", "gt", "ge", "lt", "le".

    `kind` switches the input type:
      - "float": continuous slider (use min/max/step)
      - "int": integer slider (use min/max/step=1)
      - "bool": checkbox
      - "enum": <select> dropdown; supply `enum_options`
    Bowtie's phase_lr_deg uses a signed range — kind="float" with min<0.

    For "enum" params, `enum_options` is a tuple of free-form dicts. Each
    dict must have at least {"value", "label"}; antennas can attach
    arbitrary extra keys to drive related controls. Fan_dipole's per-band
    `band_id` carries {"value": "20m", "label": "20m", "freq_min": 14.0,
    "freq_max": 14.35, "freq_default": 14.175} so a sibling freq slider
    can read its bounds + default off the active band.

    `range_from_enum_option` lets a slider's min/max/step come from the
    currently-selected enum value of a sibling param. Shape:
    {"param": <enum_param_name>, "min_key": <key>, "max_key": <key>}.

    `on_change_set` is a side-effect rule: when this enum changes value,
    write a sibling param using a key from the new enum option. Shape:
    {"set": <sibling_name>, "from_enum_key": <key>}. Fan_dipole's
    band_id uses {"set": "freq", "from_enum_key": "freq_default"} so
    flipping the band pulldown snaps the freq slider to that band's
    centre.

    `linked_to_design_freq` means this param's value also drives the
    global designFreq state on the frontend. Fan_dipole uses it on
    `bands[0].freq` so the first band's frequency stays the antenna's
    design frequency without a separate global slider.

    generalises: a trapped multi-bander would have a group with

    with {driver_factor, reflector_factor, n_directors, ...} possibly
    containing its own nested director sub-group.
