"""FastAPI server for the interactive antenna UI.

All geometries live in web.examples — each registered antenna bundles its
pysim solve/sweep and pynec build/solve into one file. Dispatchers here
look the geometry up in EXAMPLES and call its callables; adding or
removing an antenna doesn't touch this file.

The response shape is uniform across geometries — each wire is a sequence of
knots with per-knot complex currents and the feed lives on one of the wires —
so the frontend draws every geometry the same way.

# Older comment explaining why we used to pin everything to 1: the interactive
# workload is many small solves (≤ 250×250 dense complex matrices), and on
# the pre-gather-scatter code path thread orchestration costs dwarfed the
# per-call work — a 2-director live solve went from 220 ms (8 threads) to
# 67 ms (1 thread) on an 8-core box. That regression is no longer reproducible
# with the current build: matrix fill itself parallelizes, the OMP team is
# spawned once per cmset(), and OpenBLAS contention is removed by the
